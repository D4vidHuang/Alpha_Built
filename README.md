## Usage
This project consists of two parts: the frontend and the backend. Please follow the instructions below to run each part.

### Frontend

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the `alpha-built-frontend` folder, which is a subfolder in the main project folder.

```bash
   cd alpha-built-frontend
```

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Once the installation is complete, start the frontend development server by running the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
# This command will build and serve the frontend application, and you should see output indicating that the server is running.
```

5. Open your web browser and visit 'http://localhost:5173' to access the frontend application.

### Backend
1. Open your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) or a terminal/command prompt. Here we suggest you to use IntelliJ (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), developed by JetBrains.

2. Make sure you are using java version **17**.

3. Nevigate to `alpha-built-backend/src/main/java/com/ecadi/alphabuiltbackend/AlphaBuiltBackendApplication.java`.
```bash
cd alpha-built-backend/src/main/java/com/ecadi/alphabuiltbackend
```
4. Run the `AlphaBuiltBackendApplication` class as a Java application. This will start the backend server and you should see output indicating that the server has started successfully.

5. The backend API is now running on `http://localhost:8080`. You can send HTTP requests to this address to interact with the backend. But we suggest you to use our frontend pages to experience the various features.
