# Retrospective sprint 2

---

**What we have researched/done** \
1. The group has made new research and changes to the project plan according to the feedback given by TA/COACH/TECHNICAL WRITING.
2. Details about the project requirements and their difficulty and time limitations has been reviewed and discussed within the group.
3. The actual implementation about Babylon.js and Spring framework has been researched respectively and some changes has been made for the multi-user mode behavior and new front-end framework VUE has been considered.


**What we succeeded in and why?** \
1. New front-end framework VUE has been implemented to regenerate the welcome page and support for futher development to keep consistency.
2. Multi-user communication message format and parser has been made and tested.
3. Websockets conncetion has been successfully established and tested with the multi-user communication message format.
4. Importer/Exporter for externel model/sources has been implemented and tested.
The group adjusted the technical details based on the feedback and new research to enable better behavior for the system. Thanks to the flexible development and future consideration, the adjustments have been smoothly implemented.

**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
1. Though the websockets and the communicaiton message format has been determined, it still requires extra effort to combined the websockets with the 3D modeling functions to achieve the final effect that users can modefiy and see the same scene.
2. The back-end requires refactoring to support new front-end framework VUE, as this is a new technical solution we have rare knowledge before, thus more efforts are needed.
3. The importer/exporter requires more time to support more file format and keep them consistent in the system for better future modefication.
