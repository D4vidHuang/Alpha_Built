**What we have researched/done** \
1. The group has made research about the technical background according to the project requirements.
2. Technical choices have been made for both front-end and back-end after discussion: 
	1. For front-end, babylon.js/three.js/webgl will be our first choices to support 3D relevant functions/features.
	2. For back-end, Spring framework will be the first choice to enable user account management and multi-user mode support.


**What we succeeded in and why?** \
1. Basic elements 3D modeling has been supported by the system.
2. Basic user sign-up and login has been supported by the system.
The group made great efforts in researching possible technical solutions and decided details during serval meetings. The technical framework also has sufficient integred information for the group to develop the functions according to the project requirements.

**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
This is the first week for coding and implementation, everything works as expected.
