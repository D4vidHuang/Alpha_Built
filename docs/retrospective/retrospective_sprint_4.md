# Retrospective sprint 4

---

**What we have researched/done** \
1. We reviewed and discussed our work from last week, which includes Vue, authentication, export/import, and WebSocket.
2. We gathered and analyzed feedback from the coach, particularly about managing our workload by moving some items from MUST to SHOULD/COULD.
3. We set a time schedule for our midterm exam.
4. We started planning and preparing for the following tasks: adjusting the project plan, improving the front-end interface, making sure the WebSocket is working, and preparing a demo for the midterm assessment.
5. We also addressed any other business and clarified our needs for the midterm assessment and the schedule for TA meetings.


**What we succeeded in and why?** \
1. We successfully reviewed and learned from our work over the past week, which allowed us to improve our processes and techniques.
2. We utilized the coach's feedback effectively, which helped us manage our workload better by prioritizing tasks.
3. We managed to set a clear time schedule for the midterm exam, ensuring everyone in the team is aware and prepared for the same.
4. We started planning for next week's tasks effectively, setting a clear direction for what needs to be done.
5. Our communication has improved as we made sure everyone's concerns were heard and addressed, including preparation for the midterm assessment and TA meetings.

**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
1. As this week was primarily about planning and setting the direction for the project, there wasn't any concrete deliverable we were expecting to achieve. However, the planning and preparation process is a crucial aspect of the overall project execution, and we accomplished that effectively.
2. We couldn't finalize some details about the presentation for the midterm assessment, including whether we need presentation slides or other materials. We will work on these details in the coming week.
