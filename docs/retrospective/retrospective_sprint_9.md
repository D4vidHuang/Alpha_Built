**What we have researched/done** \
1. We have received and carefully analyzed the feedback on our report.
2. We made substantial progress in finalizing our report, addressing feedback and refining our explanations.
3. We have begun preparing our presentation, focusing on clearly communicating our project's goals, progress, and results.


**What we succeeded in and why?** \
1. We've made great strides in improving our report based on the received feedback. The team was receptive and responsive, which greatly expedited this process.
2. Our preparation for the presentation has been fruitful. With the collective efforts of our team, we have been able to design an engaging and informative presentation.
3. Despite the intense focus on the report and presentation, we have managed to maintain steady progress in the remaining project areas. This is a testament to our team's ability to multitask effectively.

**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
1. The finalization of the report is still ongoing. Although we've made significant progress, we want to ensure every detail is perfect before submission.
2. The presentation is not fully ready yet. We want to rehearse and refine it to ensure it communicates our project effectively.
3. As the project is nearing its completion, the pace of work has increased, and some minor tasks might have been overlooked. We aim to address these in the coming week.
