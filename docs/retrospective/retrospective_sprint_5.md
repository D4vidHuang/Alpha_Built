# Retrospective sprint 5

---

**What we have researched/done** \
1. We have reviewed our progress on version control, authentication/authorization, and connecting multiple users with our new UI.
2. We discussed the possibility of changing the requirements based on our current progress and challenges faced.
3. We have received feedback from the TA on our pipeline and our overall project progress.
4. We scheduled our next TA meeting and clarified the agenda for the same.


**What we succeeded in and why?** \
1. Our implementation of version control, authentication/authorization, and multi-user connectivity with the new UI has been successful. This is largely due to the team's efforts in researching and implementing effective strategies.
2. We had a productive discussion about changing the project requirements, understanding the flexibility and limitations of our project scope.
3. We received valuable feedback from the TA, which will help us improve our project pipeline and progress in the next stages.
4. Scheduling and planning for the next TA meeting was smooth and efficient, which can be attributed to the improved coordination and communication within the team.

**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
1. Although we discussed changing the project requirements, we have not yet reached a definitive conclusion. This is mainly due to the complexity of the project and the need for further discussion and analysis.
2. The next sprint's specific tasks are still unclear, pending further discussion after the upcoming TA meeting. This was deliberate as we wish to incorporate the TA's feedback before deciding on our next steps.
