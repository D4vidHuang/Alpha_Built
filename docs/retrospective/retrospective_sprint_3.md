# Retrospective sprint 3

---

**What we have researched/done** \
1. We managed to add a login and register backend for the project.
2. We added a basic frontend page and database for the data management: 
	1. For frontend page, we added a nice button and logo to it.
	2. For database, we added a H2 database which is easy to use and maintain.


**What we succeeded in and why?** \
1. We added a basic login and register backend for the project. 
2. We added a basic frontend page and database for the data management.
We managed to do this bacause of all group members are both working hard and we set up a regular meeting with the client and TA, which enables us to get enough feedback from them.

**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
We failed to get a fully approved requirement by the TU Coach, because of the public holiday in client's country and we are still contacting the TU Coach.
