# Retrospective sprint 8

---

**What we have researched/done** \
1. We've made significant progress on the implementation of the version control system.
2. We've successfully linked the registration section and project section.
3. We continued to move forward with other implementation tasks.
4. We've made advancements in our testing processes.
5. We addressed and discussed other progress-related issues.


**What we succeeded in and why?** \
1. The progress in the version control system implementation is substantial, which is due to our team's diligent work and effective collaboration.
2. The registration section and project section are now successfully linked, thanks to our team's careful planning and efficient coding.
3. Despite the breadth of our tasks, we were able to achieve significant progress in various areas of implementation due to good project management and task allocation.
4. Our team's strong focus on ensuring high-quality code led to substantial progress in testing processes.
5. We have been able to address and discuss progress-related issues in a timely manner due to our team's strong communication and problem-solving skills.

**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
1. Finalising the implementation and testing of the system is still ongoing. This is primarily due to the complexity of the tasks and the need to ensure a high level of quality in our work.
2. System profiling and finalizing the report have yet to start, as we decided to complete the main implementation tasks before moving on to these next steps.
3. The process of cleaning up the system and removing unnecessary / unused folders for delivery and deployment is still pending. We have planned to do this in the upcoming week.
