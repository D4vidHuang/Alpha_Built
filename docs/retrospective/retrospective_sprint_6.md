# Retrospective sprint 6

---

**What we have researched/done** \
1. We continued our work on version control, authentication/authorization, and connecting multi-users with our new UI.
2. We thoroughly discussed and documented the requirements that were changed in response to project needs and challenges.
3. We received and analyzed feedback from our TA regarding our project pipeline and overall progress.


**What we succeeded in and why?** \
1. Our ongoing work on version control, authentication/authorization, and multi-user connectivity is showing considerable progress. The consistent efforts of the team and our relentless focus on these critical areas have helped us succeed.
2. We successfully managed to change and document the new requirements after extensive discussions and consideration of project needs. This has been possible due to the team's adaptive mindset and ability to respond to changing conditions.
3. The feedback received from our TA was constructive and has given us key insights on improving our project pipeline and managing progress. Our openness to feedback and eagerness to improve played a significant role in this.

**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
1. Although we have made progress in key areas, there are still ongoing tasks that are yet to be completed. This is part of our planned schedule and these tasks are expected to be completed in the coming weeks.
2. As we are waiting for further guidance from the upcoming TA meeting, we haven't outlined specific tasks for the next sprint. We believe it's crucial to incorporate the TA's feedback before defining the next steps.
