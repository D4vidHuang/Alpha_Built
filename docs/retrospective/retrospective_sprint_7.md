# Retrospective sprint 7

---

**What we have researched/done** \
1. We focused on the design of the multiuser implementation and explored strategies for effective message routing.
2. We put significant effort into implementing version control for the front end.
3. We sought the coach's guidance on handling latency issues.
4. We worked on various testing methodologies, including unit tests, mock tests, and integration tests.
5. We conducted a reformatting of Gitlab, adjusting weights as necessary.
6. Additionally, we embarked on researching router efficiencies, technical writing for the report, and the implementation of CI/CD with tests.


**What we succeeded in and why?** \
1. The design of the multiuser implementation has shown promising results. The team's innovative approach and thorough research into message routing have played a significant role in this success.
2. Implementing version control on the front end has been successful, contributing to smoother and more efficient operations.
3. The implementation of a variety of tests, including unit, mock, and integration tests, has helped us identify potential issues early and maintain high-quality code.
4. Through effective communication and collaborative problem-solving, we have managed to handle latency issues with the coach's guidance.
5. Gitlab reformatting was successfully carried out, improving project organization and management.

**What we did not accomplish and why?** \
1. While we have begun researching router efficiencies and technical writing for the report, we have yet to fully complete these tasks due to the breadth and depth of the topics.
2. CI/CD with tests has not yet been fully implemented. This is a complex task that will require further time to complete effectively.
3. New feature addition, such as frame mode and textures, has been postponed until after testing is finished to ensure a robust code base before expanding functionality.
