Summary of last week

    Significant progress was made on the design and implementation of the multi-user system. The routing of messages was changed for efficiency and to accommodate multiple users.

    The latency issue has been addressed in consultation with the coach, and steps have been taken to minimize it in the system.

    Version control for the front-end was implemented. Now all changes are properly tracked, allowing the team to revert to previous states if necessary.

    Testing was a major focus of last week's work. The team implemented a variety of tests, including unit tests, mock tests, and integration tests, to ensure the system is functioning as intended.

    To maintain good project management practices, GitLab was reformatted, including adjustments in weights.

    Initial draft of the report was completed.

Tasks of next week

    The team will focus on adding new features such as frame mode and textures after finishing the tests.

    As the project approaches its final stages, the team will start preparing for the report submission and the final presentation.

    The team will also delve into further research in routing for efficient backend message handling, technical writing for the final report, and the implementation of CI/CD with tests.
