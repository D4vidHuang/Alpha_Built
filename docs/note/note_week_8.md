    Location: TU Delft Education Building 35

    Group number: 5C

Summary of last week

    We made significant progress on the implementation of the version control system.

    We succeeded in linking the registration section with the project section. This will enhance the user experience and the overall fluidity of the system.

    Other implementation tasks were completed and are ready for further testing.

    We continued our rigorous testing process, identifying any remaining issues to be addressed in the final week of implementation.

    We also discussed other progress-related topics and confirmed the steps we need to take moving forward.

Tasks of next week

    We plan to finalize the implementation and testing of the system.

    We'll begin profiling the system, which will be a critical part of our final report.

    We aim to simplify our system by removing unnecessary or unused folders. This will ensure that the final product we deliver is as clean and user-friendly as possible.

Any other business

    We're awaiting feedback on the draft of our report. We hope to incorporate this feedback into our final version to make it as strong as possible.

    We're also keen to understand our current status in the grading session, and whether there's anything we can do to improve our score.
