TA Meeting Week 5
Information

    Date: 01/06/2023

    Location: TU Delft Education Building 35

    Group number: 5C

Summary of last week

    We've made significant progress in implementing version control. All changes are now properly tracked, allowing us to revert to previous states if necessary.

    The authentication/authorization service is up and running. The system now securely manages user data, ensuring that only authorized users have access to sensitive information.

    The multi-user system is now fully integrated with our new UI. Multiple users can now interact with the system simultaneously without conflicts or synchronization issues.

    Feedback from the TA has been received and incorporated into our work. Particularly, we've made improvements in our pipeline and overall progress tracking.

Tasks of next week

    We will reflect on our current requirements and see if changes are needed based on feedback and our own observations.

    After the TA meeting, we will discuss about our next sprint and come up with a clear and achievable action plan.

    Continue developing the system according to the requirements and address any issues that might arise during this process.

    Schedule the next TA meeting and prepare relevant questions and discussion points.

Feedback

    The TA's feedback was highly beneficial in identifying areas of improvement in our project. We'll keep incorporating the feedback in our future work.
