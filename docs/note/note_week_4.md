###### Summary of last week

- The majority of our team is becoming familiar with Vue.js.
- Zhejia has implemented the WebSocket utility on the backend to support 
  multi-user functionality.
- We had our first meeting with our coach. After a thorough analysis of our 
  requirements, he suggested that we scale back most of the "must-have" 
  requirements, as they seemed unfeasible. He recommended that we focus more 
  on the multi-user feature.
- We were informed that there will be no TA meeting next week due to the 
  mid-term meeting.
- Zhejia demonstrated the first instance of multi-user interaction.

###### Tasks of next week

- Improve the design; the client will provide their preferred design of the 
  webpages in the upcoming client meeting.
- Complete the basic multi-user functionality via WebSocket.
- We need to prepare a slide for the mid-term meeting. For further details, 
  the TA suggested that we refer to the mid-term rubric.
- Move finished issues to the "finished" state in the milestone tracker.
- We should add more issues to GitLab.
- Add a descriptive title or brief description to the milestone.
- Consider adding more labels for better organization.
- Add a **pipeline** to GitLab.
- Complete the `BuddyCheck` assignment.
- Refrain from pushing to GitLab for every minor commit due to high server 
  load. Only push when necessary.
