# Opening
*Here you check that everybody is present.*
Stand up meeting, report what we have done during the past week.

# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*
We need to talk about the following things:\
1. Summary of last week (vue, authentication, export/import, websocket)
2. Feedback from the coach (reducing the work in MUST have and move them into SHOULD/COULD)
3. Time schedule for midterm (for now 9:00a.m. on next Thursday)

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*
We'd like to make sure the following things will start next week:
1. Adjust the project plan according to the feedback.
2. Improve the front end interface according to the client's design.
3. Make sure the websocket works.
4. Prepare a demo for what we have done so far and display it during the midterm assessment.

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*
The following things will be noticed:
1. Finish the buddy check in time.
2. For midterm assessment, do we need any presentation slides/report or other staff?
3. Do we still have ta meetings next week or combined with the midterm assessment?

# Questions for the TA
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*

# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
