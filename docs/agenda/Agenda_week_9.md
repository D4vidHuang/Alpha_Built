We need to talk about the following things:

2. The progress of the report.
3. The presentation.

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)

Finalise the report and presentation.

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*
Discuss the report issue.
