# Opening
*Here you check that everybody is present.*
Stand up meeting, report what we have done during the past week.

# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*
We need to talk about the following things:

1. The progress of implementation of the version control system.
2. The progress of linking the registration section and project section.
3. The progress of other implementation tasks.
4. The progress of testing.
5. The progress of other progress related issues.

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*
We'd like to make sure the following things will start next week:
1. We will finalise the implementation and testing of the system.
2. We will begin profiling the system and finalise the report.
3. We will begin wrapping up the system by removing unnecessary / unused folders such that the gitlab could be delivered and deployed.

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*
The following things will be noticed:
1. When could we get the feedback of report draft.
2. What is the current status of our progress grading session, anything could be improved.

# Questions for the TA
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*

# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
